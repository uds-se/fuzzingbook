    "# Fuzzing with Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter on [\"Mutation-Based Fuzzing\"](MutationFuzzer.ipynb), we have seen how to use extra hints – such as sample input files – to speed up test generation.  In this chapter, we take this idea one step further, by providing a _specification_ of the legal inputs to a program.  Specifying inputs via a _grammar_ allows for very systematic and efficient test generation, in particular for complex input formats.  Grammars also serve as the base for configuration fuzzing, API fuzzing, GUI fuzzing, and many more."

The set of all these inputs determines how the program will behave – including its failures.  When testing, it is thus very helpful to think about possible input sources, how to get them under control, and _how to systematically test them_."

Languages range from the simple to the complex: the CSV language denotes the set of valid comma-separated inputs, whereas the Python language denotes the set of valid Python programs.  We commonly separate data languages and programming languages, although any program can also be treated as input data (say, to a compiler).  The [Wikipedia page on file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_formats) lists more than 1,000 different file formats, each of which is its own language."

A Turing machine can compute anything that can be computed; and with Python being Turing-complete, this means that we can also use a Python program $p$ to specify or even enumerate legal inputs.

    "One very useful property of grammars is that they produce mostly valid inputs.  From a syntactical standpoint, the inputs are actually _always_ valid, as they satisfy the constraints of the given grammar.  (Of course, one needs a valid grammar in the first place.)  However, there are also _semantic_ properties that cannot be easily expressed in a grammar.  If, say, for a URL, the port range is supposed to be between 1024 and 2048, this is hard to write in a grammar.  If one has to satisfy more complex constraints, one quickly reaches the limits of what a grammar can express."

Another possibility is to put together the strengths of grammar-based fuzzing and [mutation-based fuzzing](MutationFuzzer.ipynb).  The idea is to use the grammar-generated inputs as *seeds* for further mutation-based fuzzing.  This way, we can explore not only _valid_ inputs, but also check out the _boundaries_ between valid and invalid inputs.  This is particularly interesting as  slightly invalid inputs allow finding parser errors (which are often abundant).  As with fuzzing in general, it is the unexpected which reveals errors in programs."

The first _formalization_ of generative grammars was by Dakṣiputra Pāṇini in 350 BC \\cite{Panini350bce}.  As a general means to express formal languages for both data and programs, their role in computer science cannot be overstated.  The seminal work by Chomsky \\cite{Chomsky1956} introduced the central models of regular languages, context-free grammars, context-sensitive grammars, and universal grammars as they are used (and taught) in computer science as a means to specify input and programming languages ever since."
