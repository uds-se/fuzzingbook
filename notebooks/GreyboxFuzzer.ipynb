    "In the [previous chapter](MutationFuzzer.ipynb), we have introduced _mutation-based fuzzing_, a technique that generates fuzz inputs by applying small mutations to given inputs. In this chapter, we show how to _guide_ these mutations towards specific goals such as coverage. The algorithms in this chapter stem from the popular [American Fuzzy Lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) (AFL) fuzzer, in particular from its [AFLFast](https://github.com/mboehme/aflfast) and [AFLGo](https://github.com/aflgo/aflgo) flavors. We will explore the greybox fuzzing algorithm behind AFL and how we can exploit it to solve various problems for automated vulnerability detection."

    "* A *greybox fuzzer* generates thousands of inputs per second. Pre-processing and lightweight instrumentation \n",
    "  * allows maintaining the efficiency *during* the fuzzing campaign, and \n",
    "  * still provides enough information to control progress and slightly steer the fuzzer.\n",
    "* The *power schedule* allows _steering and controlling_ the fuzzer. For instance,\n",
    "  * Our [boosted greybox fuzzer](#Fuzzer-Boosting) spends more energy on seeds that exercise \"unlikely\" paths. The hope is that the generated inputs exercise even more unlikely paths. This in turn increases the number of paths explored per unit time.\n",
    "  * Our [directed greybox fuzzer](#Directed-Greybox-Fuzzing) spends more energy on seeds that are \"closer\" to a target location. The hope is that the generated inputs get even closer to the target.\n",
    "* The *mutator* defines the fuzzer's search space. [Customizing the mutator](GreyboxFuzzer.ipynb#A-First-Attempt) for the given program allows reducing the search space to only relevant inputs. In a couple of chapters, we'll learn about [dictionary-based, and grammar-based mutators](GreyboxGrammarFuzzer.ipynb) to increase the ratio of valid inputs generated."

The concept of a \"population\" that is systematically \"evolved\" through \"mutations\" will be explored in depth when discussing [search-based testing](SearchBasedFuzzer.ipynb).  Furthermore, [symbolic testing](SymbolicFuzzer.ipynb) introduces how to systematically reach program locations by solving the conditions that lie on their paths.\n",
