    "# Mining Input Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the grammars we have seen have been mostly specified manually – that is, you (or the person knowing the input format) had to design and write a grammar in the first place.  While the grammars we have seen so far have been rather simple, creating a grammar for complex inoputs can involve quite some effort.  In this chapter, we therefore introduce techniques that automatically _mine_ grammars from programs – by executing the programs and observing how they process which parts of the input.  In conjunction with a grammar fuzzer, this allows us to (1) take a program, (2) extract its input grammar, and (3) fuzz it with high efficiency and effectiveness."
