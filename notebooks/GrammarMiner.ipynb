    "# Mining Input Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the grammars we have seen have been mostly specified manually – that is, you (or the person knowing the input format) had to design and write a grammar in the first place.  While the grammars we have seen so far have been rather simple, creating a grammar for complex inputs can involve quite some effort.  In this chapter, we therefore introduce techniques that _automatically mine grammars from programs_ – by executing the programs and observing how they process which parts of the input.  In conjunction with a grammar fuzzer, this allows us to \n",

While this may seem rather error-prone compared to dynamic tainting, we note that numerous tracing tools such as `dtrace()` and `ptrace()` allow one to obtain the information we seek from execution of binaries directly in different platforms. However, methods for obtaining dynamic taints almost always involve instrumenting the binaries before they can be used. Hence, this method of string inclusion can be more generally applied than dynamic tainting approaches. Further, dynamic taints are often lost due to implicit transmission, or at the boundary between *Python* and *C* code. String inclusion has not such problems. Hence, our approach can often obtain better results than relying on dynamic tainting."

    "Recovering the language from a _set of samples_ (i.e., not taking into account a possible program that might process them) is a well researched topic.  The excellent reference by Higuera \\cite{higuera2010grammatical} covers all the classical approaches. The current state of the art in black box grammar mining is described by Clark \\cite{clark2013learning}.\n",

    "Learning an input language from a _program_, with or without samples, is yet an emerging topic, despite its potential for fuzzing.  The pioneering work in this area was done by Lin et al. \\cite{Lin2008} who invented a way to retrieve the parse trees from top down and bottom up parsers. The approach described in this chapter is based directly on the AUTOGRAM work of Hoschele et al. \\cite{Hoschele2017}."
