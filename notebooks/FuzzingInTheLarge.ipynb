    "In the past chapters, we have always looked at fuzzing taking place on one machine for a few seconds only.  In the real world, however, fuzzers are run on dozens or even thousands of machines; for hours, days and weeks; for one program or dozens of programs.  In such contexts, one needs an _infrastructure_ to _collect_ failure data from the individual fuzzer runs, and to _aggregate_ such data in a central repository.  In this chapter, we will examine such an infrastructure, the _FuzzManager_ framework from Mozilla."

Failures would be shown immediately, and diagnosed quickly by the same person who started the fuzzer.  Alas, testing in the real world is different.  Fuzzing is still fully automated; but now, we are talking about _multiple_ fuzzers running on _multiple_ machines testing _multiple_ programs (and versions thereof), producing _multiple_ failures that have to be handled by _multiple_ people.
