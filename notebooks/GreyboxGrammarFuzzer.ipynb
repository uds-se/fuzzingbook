    "# Greybox Fuzzing with Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce important extensions to our syntactic fuzzing techniques, all leveraging _syntactic_ parts of _existing inputs_.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We show how to leverage _dictionaries_ of input fragments during fuzzing. The idea is to integrate such dictionaries into a _mutator_, which would then inject these fragments (typically keywords and other items of importance) into population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We show how to combine [parsing](Parser.ipynb) and [fuzzing](GrammarFuzzer.ipynb) with grammars.  This allows _mutating_ existing inputs while preserving syntactical correctness, and to _reuse_ fragments from existing inputs while generating new ones.  The combination of language-based parsing and generating, as demonstrated in this chapter, has been highly successful in practice: The _LangFuzz_ fuzzer for JavaScript has found more than 2,600 bugs in JavaScript interpreters this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the previous chapters, we have used grammars in a _black-box_ manner – that is, we have used them to generate inputs regardless of the program being tested.  In this chapter, we introduce mutational _greybox fuzzing with grammars_: Techniques that make use of _feedback from the program under test_ to guide test generations towards specific goals.  As in [lexical greybox fuzzing](GreyboxFuzzer.ipynb), this feedback is mostly _coverage_, allowing us to direct grammar-based testing towards uncovered code parts. This part is inspired by the _AFLSmart_ fuzzer, which combines parsing and mutational fuzzing."

    "## Mining Seeds\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, it should have become clear that the _choice of seeds_ can very much influence the success of fuzzing.  One aspect is _variability_ – our seeds should cover as many different features as possible in order to increase coverage.  Another aspect, however, is the _likelihood of a seed to induce errors_ – that is, if a seed was involved in causing a failure before, then a mutation of this very seed may be likely to induce failures again.  This is because fixes for past failures typically are successful in letting the concrete failure no longer occur, but sometimes may fail to capture all conditions under which a failure may occur.  Hence, even if the original failure is fixed, the likelihood of an error in the _surroundings_ of the original failure-inducing input is still higher.  It thus pays off to use as seeds _inputs that are known to have caused failures before_.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put things in context, Holler's _LangFuzz_ fuzzer used as seeds JavaScript inputs from CVE reports.  These were published as failure-inducing inputs at a time when the error already had been fixed; thus they could do no harm anymore.  Yet, by using such inputs as seeds, LangFuzz would create plenty of mutations and recombinations of all their features, many of which would (and do) find errors again and again."

    "* A **dictionary** is useful to inject important keywords into the generated inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fragment-based mutation** first disassembles seeds into fragments, and reassembles these fragments to generate new inputs. A *fragment* is a subtree in the seed's parse tree. However, fragment-based mutation requires that the seeds can be parsed successfully, which may not be true for seeds discovered by a coverage-based greybox fuzzer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Region-based mutation** marks regions in the input as belonging to a certain symbol in the grammar. For instance, it may identify a substring '</a>' as closing tag. These regions can then be deleted or substituted by fragments or regions belonging to the same symbol. Unlike fragment-based mutation, region-based mutation is applicable to *all* seeds - even those that can be parsed only partially. However, the degree of validity is still quite low for the generated inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **validity-based power schedule** invests more energy into seeds with a higher degree of validity. The inputs that are generated also have a higher degree of validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mining seeds** from repositories of previous failure-inducing inputs results in input fragments associated with past failures, raising the likelihood to find more failures in the vicinity."

    "\n",
    "* Smart greybox fuzzing ([AFLSmart](https://github.com/aflsmart/aflsmart)) brings together coverage-based fuzzing and grammar-based (structural) fuzzing, as described in \\cite{Pham2018aflsmart}.  The resulting AFLSMART tool has discovered 42 zero-day vulnerabilities in widely-used, well-tested tools and libraries; so far 17 CVEs were assigned."

    "Recent fuzzing work also brings together grammar-based fuzzing and coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Superion_ \\cite{Wang2019superion} is equivalent to our section \"Integration with Greybox Fuzzing\", as above – that is, a combination of LangFuzz and Greybox Fuzzing, but no AFL-style byte-level mutation.  Superion can improve the code coverage (i.e., 16.7% and 8.8% in line and function coverage) and bug-finding capability over AFL and jsfunfuzz.  According to the authors, they found 30 new bugs, among which they discovered 21 new vulnerabilities with 16 CVEs assigned and 3.2K USD bug bounty rewards received.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Nautilus_ \\cite{Aschermann2019nautilus} also combines grammar-based fuzzing with coverage feedback.  It maintains the parse tree for all seeds and generated inputs. To allow AFL-style byte-level mutations, it \"collapses\" subtrees back to byte-level representations.  This has the advantage of not having to re-parse generated seeds; however, over time, Nautilus degenerates to structure-unaware greybox fuzzing because it does not re-parse collapsed subtrees to reconstitute input structure for later seeds where most of the parse tree is collapsed.  Nautilus identified bugs in mruby, PHP, ChakraCore, and in Lua; reporting these bugs was awarded with a sum of 2600 USD and 6 CVEs were assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [FormatFuzzer](https://uds-se.github.io/FormatFuzzer/) is a framework for high-efficiency, high-quality generation and parsing of binary inputs. It takes a binary template that describes the format of a binary input and generates an executable that produces and parses the given binary format. From a binary template for GIF, for instance, FormatFuzzer produces a GIF generator - also known as GIF fuzzer. Generators produced by FormatFuzzer are highly efficient, producing thousands of valid test inputs per second. FormatFuzzer operates in black-box settings, but can also integrate with AFL to produce valid inputs that also aim for maximum coverage."
