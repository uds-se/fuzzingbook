This is true even for innocuous elements such as numbers – yes, the numbers we have generated so far actually _differ_ from numbers in the real world.  This is because in real-life sets of numerical data, the _leading significant digit_ is likely to be small: Actually, on average, the leading digit `1` occurs more than _six times_ as often as the leading digit `8` or `9`.  It has been shown that this result applies to a wide variety of data sets, including electricity bills, street addresses, stock prices, house prices, population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, physical and mathematical constants (Wikipedia)."
