    "The \"lexical\" delta debugging algorithm discussed here stems from \\cite{Zeller2002}; actually, this is the exact Python implementation as used by Zeller in 2002.  The idea of systematically reducing inputs has been discovered a number of times, although not as automatic and generic as delta debugging. \\cite{Slutz1998}, for instance, discusses systematic reduction of SQL statements for SQL databases; the general process as manual work is well described by \\cite{Kernighan1999}."

    "The deficits of delta debugging as it comes to syntactically complex inputs were first discussed in *compiler testing*, and _reducing tree inputs_ rather than string inputs was quickly discovered as an alternative.  *Hierarchical Delta Debugging* (*HDD*) \\cite{Misherghi2006} applies delta debugging on subtrees of a parse tree, systematically reducing a parse tree to a minimum.  _Generalized Tree Reduction_ \\cite{Herfert2017} generalizes this idea to apply arbitrary _patterns_ such as replacing a term by a compatible term in a subtree, as `subtrees_with_symbol()` does.  Using _grammars_ to reduce inputs was first implemented in the _Perses_ tool \\cite{Sun2018}; our algorithm implements very similar strategies.  Searching for alternate expansions (as `alternate_reductions()`) is a contribution of the present chapter."

Besides reductions in the style of delta debugging or tree transformations, C-Reduce comes with more than 30 source-to-source transformations that replace aggregates by scalars, remove function parameters at a definition and all call sites, change functions to return `void` and deleting all `return` statements, and many more.  While specifically instantiated for the C language (and used for testing C compilers), these principles extend to arbitrary programming languages following an ALGOL-like syntax.\n",
