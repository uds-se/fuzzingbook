    "# When To Stop Fuzzing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past chapters, we have discussed several fuzzing techniques.  Knowing _what_ to do is important, but it is also important to know when to _stop_ doing things.  In this chapter, we will learn when to _stop fuzzing_ – and use a prominent example for this purpose: The *Enigma* machine that was used in the second world war by the navy of Nazi Germany to encrypt communications, and how Alan Turing and I.J. Good used _fuzzing techniques_ to crack ciphers for the Naval Enigma machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turing did not only develop the foundations of computer science, the Turing machine. Together with his assistant I.J. Good, he also invented estimators of the probability of an event occurring that has never previously occurred. We show how the Good-Turing estimator can be used to quantify the *residual risk* of a fuzzing campaign that finds no vulnerabilities. Meaning, we show how it estimates the probability of discovering a vulnerability when no vulnerability has been observed before throughout the fuzzing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss means to speed up [coverage-based fuzzers](Coverage.ipynb) and introduce a range of estimation and extrapolation methodologies to assess and extrapolate fuzzing progress and residual risk."
