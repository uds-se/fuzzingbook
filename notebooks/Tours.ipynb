    "3. __Get [coverage](Coverage.ipynb) from your program__ and use coverage information to [guide test generation towards code coverage](GreyboxFuzzer.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Define an [input grammar](Grammars.ipynb) for your program__ and use this grammar to thoroughly fuzz your program with syntactically correct inputs.  As fuzzer, we would recommend a [grammar coverage fuzzer](GrammarCoverageFuzzer), as this ensures coverage of input elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. __The [syntactical tour](03_Syntactical_Fuzzing.ipynb)__ focuses on _grammars_ as a means to specify the syntax of inputs.  The resulting test generators produce syntactically correct inputs, making tests much faster, and provide lots of control mechanisms for the tester.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __The [semantical tour](04_Semantical_Fuzzing.ipynb)__ makes use of _code semantics_ to shape and guide test generation.  Advanced techniques include extracting input grammars, mining function specifications, and symbolic constraint solving to cover as many code paths as possible.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. __[Mutation-based fuzzing](MutationFuzzer.ipynb)__ is pretty much the standard in fuzzing today: Take a set of seeds, and mutate them until we find a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Learn how [grammars](Grammars.ipynb) can be used to generate syntactically correct inputs.__  This makes test generation much more efficient, but you have to write (or [mine](GrammarMiner.ipynb) a grammar in the first place.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Get an introduction to __[configuration testing](ConfigurationFuzzer.ipynb)__.  How does one test and cover a system that comes with multiple configuration options?\n",

    "\n",
    "1. __Learn how to [parse](Parser.ipynb) inputs__ using grammars.  If you want to analyze, decompose, mutate existing inputs, you need a parser for that.\n",

    "1. __[Concolic](ConcolicFuzzer.ipynb) and [symbolic](SymbolicFuzzer.ipynb) fuzzing__ solve constraints along program paths to reach code that is hard to test.  Used wherever reliability is paramount; also a hot research topic.\n",

The conjunction with test generation offers several opportunities here, in particular for dynamic specification mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __[Mining input grammars](GrammarMiner.ipynb)__ promises to join the robustness and ease of use of lexical fuzzing with the efficiency and speed of syntactical fuzzing.  The idea is to mine an input grammar from a program automatically, which then serves as base for syntactical fuzzing.  Still in an early stage, but lots of potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __[Probabilistic grammar fuzzing](ProbabilisticGrammarFuzzer.ipynb)__ gives programmers lots of control over which elements should be generated.  Plenty of research possibilities at the intersection of probabilistic fuzzing and mining data from given tests, as sketched in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __[Fuzzing with generators](GeneratorGrammarFuzzer.ipynb)__ gives programmers the ultimate control over input generation, namely by allowing them to define their own generator functions.  The big challenge is: How can one best exploit the power of syntactic descriptions with a minimum of contextual constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __[Carving unit tests](Carver.ipynb)__ brings the promise of speeding up test execution (and generation) dramatically, by extracting unit tests from program executions that replay only individual function calls (possibly with new, generated arguments).  In Python, carving is simple to realize; here's plenty of potential to toy with.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Testing [web servers](WebFuzzer.ipynb) and [GUIs](GUIFuzzer.ipynb)__ is a hot research field, fueled by the need of practitioners to test and secure their interfaces (and the need of other practitioners to break through these interfaces).  Again, there's still lots of unexplored potential here.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __[Greybox fuzzing](GreyboxFuzzer.ipynb) and [greybox fuzzing with grammars](GreyboxGrammarFuzzer.ipynb)__  bring in _statistical estimators_ to guide test generation towards inputs and input properties that are most likely to discover new bugs.  The intersection of testing, program analysis, and statistics offers lots of possibilities for future research."
