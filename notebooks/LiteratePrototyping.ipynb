    "As scholars in Software Engineering, and as such, we teach others how to build software.  When I get asked what the most important rules for great and long-lasting software are, I usually tell these:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have a **repository** for your code where people can contribute\n",
    "2. Make sure that **anyone can build** your software automatically from the source\n",
    "3. Have **automatic tests** that you can run anytime to prevent errors after changes\n",
    "4. Be **open for extension** such that your code can be extended and reused without having to touch core functionality\n",
    "5. Have **examples and tutorials** that allow newcomers to quickly grasp how to use your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these rules will get you the most important benefits of software engineering.  We know this, as we apply them in the software we build ourselves.  Yet, for decades, we have run into the same problems again and again, eventually rendering all the above efforts useless.  Which are these problems?"

    "Much of our research consists of building software.  Not only do we build software for _conducting_ research; the software that we produce and its evaluation actually is the *result* of research.  If we have an idea on how to automatically test software, for instance, we evaluate whether the idea works by implementing the idea in a piece of software and running it on a number of (software) subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would assume that we have some plan in the beginning, craft some elegant algorithm, and then build the software according to plan.  That might be true.  Problem is, though, that the original plan seldom works perfectly, and we need to come up with new, different ideas – which again have to be implemented.  Since these were not planned for in the original software design, the software structure quickly deteriorates, and this becomes a problem.  For decades, our typical software life cycle went like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A PhD student builds some tool for a \"classic\" language, say Java or C.\n",
    "2. While building the tool, research frequently changes course.  Some ideas don't work.  We try out other ideas, which were not planned initially.  We extend the code again and again, but make little effort to get it to work beyond our subject programs.\n",
    "3. We eventually have a tool with several 10,000 lines of code, badly documented, and not very well-structured.\n",
    "4. Every time a new student comes along, the PhD student spends days and weeks introducing the new student to her code.  The new student spends weeks just figuring out how to do things.  Eventually, she manages to get things done, but then, there are only two weeks left before the thesis is due.  She spends one week on the evaluation, and one week on the write-up.  None of the results are reusable.\n",
    "5. When the PhD student leaves, her code is effectively dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how it has always been.  Ask me for the source code of some project that one of my students wrote five years ago.  I can send it to you, no problem, but you won't get it to run; the language has evolved, the tools have evolved – and there is no one left who can tell you how to do things.  Sorry.\n",

In the classroom, we typically do live coding; we start with some predefined parts and then show how the central algorithms work.  Live coding also allows for plenty of interaction – we can demonstrate alternative solutions, give live quizzes, ask the audience what they think would happen if we execute a particular line of code.  For more conventional lectures, Jupyter notebooks can be converted into very pretty slide shows.  And again, all this is enabled by the simple code and the speed of prototyping in Python."
