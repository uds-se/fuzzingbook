    "# Search-Based Fuzzing\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we are not only interested in fuzzing as many as possible diverse program inputs, but in deriving *specific* test inputs that achieve some objective, such as reaching specific statements in a program. When we have an idea of what we are looking for, then we can *search* for it. Search algorithms are at the core of computer science, but applying classic search algorithms like breadth or depth first search to search for tests is unrealistic, because these algorithms potentially require us to look at all possible inputs. However, domain-knowledge can be used to overcome this problem. For example, if we can estimate which of several program inputs is closer to the one we are looking for, then this information can guide us to reach the target quicker – this information is known as a *heuristic*. The way heuristics are applied systematically is captured in *meta-heuristic* search algorithms. The \"meta\" denotes that these algorithms are generic and can be instantiated differently to different problems. Meta-heuristics often take inspiration from processes observed in nature. For example, there are algorithms mimicking evolutionary processes, swarm intelligence, or chemical reactions. In general, they are much more efficient than exhaustive search approaches such that they can be applied to vast search spaces – search spaces as vast as the domain of program inputs are no problem for them."

    "\n",
    "Having decided on a representation (2-tuples of integers) and a fitness function (distance to target branch), we can now finally go ahead and implement our search algorithm. Let's explore this search space using the simplest possible meta-heuristic algorithm: Hillclimbing. The metaphor captures aptly what is happening: The algorithm tries to climb a hill in the search space defined by our representation. Except, that in our search landscape the best values are not those high up but down low, so technically we are descending into valleys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hillclimbing algorithm itself is very simple: \n",
    "1. Take a random starting point\n",
    "2. Determine fitness value of all neighbors\n",

The right-hand side of the equation, `2 * (y + 1)`, evaluates to 308, so the condition is clearly false. Where should the hillclimber go to now?

Thus, the value on the left-hand side of the equation thus differs *even more* to the value on the right-hand side of the equation than it did before the increase! So, increasing `y` does not seem like a good idea. On the other hand, increasing `x` by one improves things: The left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation become more similar; they are \"less unequal\". Thus, out of the eight possible neighbors of `(274, 153)`, the neighbor that increases `x` and decreases `y` (`(275, 152)`) seems best intuitively --- the outcome of the condition is still false, but it is \"less so\" than for the original value."

If `B` is an expression with side effects, then by calculating the branch distance of `B` even though short-circuit evaluation would avoid its execution, we would potentially be changing the program behavior (by invoking the side-effect that would in normal behavior not be executed), and that is not acceptable."

To replace the comparison with a function call we use an `ast.NodeTransformer`, which uses the visitor pattern where there is one `visit_*` function for each type of node in the AST. As we are interested in replacing comparisons, we override `visit_Compare`, where instead of the original comparison node we return a new node of type `ast.Func`, which is a function call node. The first parameter of this node is the name of the function `evaluate_condition()`, and the arguments are the four arguments that our `evaluate_condition()` function expects: \n",
    "\n",
    "* the number of branch (for which we keep a count in `branch_num`), \n",
    "* the operator (for which we simply use the class name), \n",
    "* the left-hand side, and \n",
    "* the right-hand side. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python allows comparisons of multiple expressions (e.g. `1 < x < 10`); to keep the code simple we only deal with individual comparisons here, but it would be straight forward to extend the code by treating each comparison with an individual call to `evaluate_condition`. You will notice that we also override `visit_FunctionDef`; this is just to change the name of the method by appending `_instrumented`, so that we can continue to use the original function together with the instrumented one."

To represent such a path, we can simply sum up the branch distances for exactly these branches. However, there is a potential issue with simply summing up branch distances: If the distance for one condition depends on a comparison of very large values and the distance calculation for another condition depends on small values, then an improvement of the large values would very likely lead to a better fitness improvement, and thus bias the search. To avoid this, we need to *normalize* branch distances before adding them up."

    "A normalization function for a range `[a, b]` takes a number as input and returns a value that is `>=a` and `<=b`. The important thing about the function is that for any two numbers `x` and `y` the ordering needs to be preserved by the normalization. That is, if `x<y` then it must also hold that `normalize(x) < normalize(y)`. There are many different functions that could achieve this result; a simple one is `normalize(x) = x/(x+k)`: It is computationally cheap, and will normalize any positive value in the range `[0,1]` (to change this to `[0,b]` one would just need to multiply by `b`). If we use this normalization function, we also know the maximum value: it is `1.0`. The function assumes that the value to be normalized is positive. The value of the factor `k` defines the steepness of the curve. For example, for `k=1` (which is a good default value) the curve is very steep, with values quickly approaching, but never reaching, `1`."

If the randomized hillclimber would reject offspring with identical fitness, it would keep mutating the identical individual, and possibly struggle to escape the plateau. If we replace also with equal fitness, we allow the search to move around the plateau, increasing chances of escaping it eventually.\n"

    "The use of a fitness value in the search is typically explained using \"survival of the fittest\", but one of Darwin’s key insights on evolution was that selection is not only defined by survival -- individuals reproduce sexually, and sexual selection describes the selection pressure during reproduction. This selection is typically influenced by either combat: rivaling males fighting over a female, and the stronger (fitter) male wins; the selection is also influenced by display. Darwin’s example for this is the peacock: The peacock has long, beautiful tail feathers that appear to serve no purpose, and do not seem to support the concept of natural selection. However, peahens are influenced in their selection of a sexual partner by his appearance. Impressive ornaments suggest that a male is genetically particularly healthy and will lead to healthy offspring. This is reflected in a GA: The better the fitness value of an individual, the more likely it is to mate with another individual. A simple selection algorithm that reflects this concept is *tournament selection*: A small number of randomly chosen individuals compete to be selected, and the best is selected:"

In contrast, if the tournament size is too small, then this inhibits evolution. The best value for the tournament size depends on the population size, but usually it is fairly small (e.g. 5).

If the mutation introduced new genetic material that represents useful traits leading to better fitness values, then this genetic material will survive. If the mutation introduced useless genetic material, then the resulting individuals will likely have bad fitness values and die off quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect is that both, mutation and crossover, are probabilistic actions. They do not always happen, and their effects are different every time they do happen. For a sequence genetic encoding, a common approach is to first use a probability to decide whether to apply mutation, and then to select one gene and change it a bit. Alternatively, we can probabilistically mutate genes such that on average one is changed. We do this by calculating a probability `P` of each gene being mutated as 1/(number of genes). Then, if a gene is mutated, we don't just replace it by a random character, but make it more likely that there is only a small change. This is achieved by sampling from a Gaussian distribution with the current value as the mean. We arbitrarily use a standard deviation of 100 to make small changes more likely than large changes."
