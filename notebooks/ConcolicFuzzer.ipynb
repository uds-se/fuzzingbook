    "We have previously seen how one can use dynamic taints to produce more intelligent test cases than simply looking for program crashes. We have also seen how one can use the taints to update the grammar, and hence focus more on the dangerous methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "While taints are helpful, uninterpreted strings is only one of the attack vectors. Can we say anything more about the properties of variables at any point in the execution? For example, can we say for sure that a function will always receive the buffers with the correct length? Concolic execution offers a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of _concolic execution_ over a function is as follows: We start with a sample input for the function, and execute the function under trace. At each point the execution passes through a conditional, we save the conditional encountered in an in the form of relations between symbolic variables.\n",
    "(A _symbolic variable_ can be thought of as a sort of placeholder for the real variable, sort of like the x in solving for x in Algebra. The symbolic variables can be used to specify relations without actually solving them.)\n",
    "\n",
    "With concolic execution, one can collect the constraints that an execution path encounters, and use it to answer questions about the program behavior at any point we prefer along the program execution path. We can further use concolic execution to enhance fuzzing.\n",
