    "In previous chapters, we have seen how [Grammar-Based Fuzzing](GrammarFuzzer.ipynb) allows us to efficiently generate myriads of syntactically valid inputs.\n",
    "However, there are _semantic_ input features that cannot be expressed in a context-free grammar, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"$X$ is the length of $Y$\";\n",
    "* \"$X$ is an identifier previously declared\"; or\n",
    "* \"$X$ should be longer than 4,096 bytes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we show how the [ISLa](https://rindphi.github.io/isla/) framework allows us to express such features as _constraints_ added to a grammar.\n",
    "By having ISLa solve these constraints automatically, we produce inputs that are not only _syntactically_ valid, but actually _semantically_ valid.\n",
    "Furthermore, such constraints allow us to very precisely _shape_ the inputs we want for testing."

    "\n",
    "and then make use of the following features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces the _ISLa framework_, consisting of \n",
    "* the _ISLa specification language_, allowing to add _constraints_ to a grammar\n",
    "* the _ISLa solver_, solving these constraints to produce semantically (and syntactically) valid inputs\n",
    "* the _ISLa checker_, checking given inputs for whether they satisfy these constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical usage of the ISLa solver is as follows.\n",
    "First, install ISLa, using \n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ pip install isla-solver\n",

    "Then, you can import the solver as\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from isla.solver import ISLaSolver  # type: ignore\n",
    "```\n",
    "The ISLa solver needs two things. First, a _grammar_ - say, US phone numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from Grammars import US_PHONE_GRAMMAR\n",
    "```\n",
    "Second, you need _constraints_ – a string expressing a condition over one or more grammar elements.\n",
    "Common functions include\n",
    "* `str.len()`, returning the length of a string\n",
    "* `str.to.int()`, converting a string to an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we instantiate the ISLa solver with a constraint stating that the area code should be above 900:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> solver = ISLaSolver(US_PHONE_GRAMMAR, \n",
    ">>>             \"\"\"\n",
    ">>>             str.to.int(<area>) > 900\n",
    ">>>             \"\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "With that, invoking `solver.solve()` returns a _solution_ for the constraints.\n",
    "\n",

    "'(901)910-7342'\n",

    "`solve()` returns a derivation tree, which typically is converted into a string using `str()` as above. The `print()` function does this implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent calls of `solve()` return more solutions:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "We see that the solver produces a number of inputs that all satisfy the constraint - the area code is always more than 900.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ISLaSolver()` constructor provides several additional parameters to configure the solver, as documented below.\n",
