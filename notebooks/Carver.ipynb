    "# Carving Unit Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have always generated _system input_, i.e. data that the program as a whole obtains via its input channels.  If we are interested in testing only a small set of functions, having to go through the system can be very inefficient.  This chapter introduces a technique known as _carving_, which, given a system test, automatically extracts a set of _unit tests_ that replicate the calls seen during the system test.  The key idea is to _record_ such calls such that we can _replay_ them later – as a whole or selectively.  On top, we also explore how to synthesize API grammars from carved unit tests; this means that we can _synthesize API tests without having to write a grammar at all._"

    "\n",
    "To [use the code provided in this chapter](Importing.ipynb), write\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from fuzzingbook.Carver import <identifier>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then make use of the following features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides means to _record and replay function calls_ during a system test.  Since individual function calls are much faster than a whole system run, such \"carving\" mechanisms have the potential to run tests much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recording Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CallCarver` class records all calls occurring while it is active.  It is used in conjunction with a `with` clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> with CallCarver() as carver:\n",
    ">>>     y = my_sqrt(2)\n",
    ">>>     y = my_sqrt(4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "After execution, `called_functions()` lists the names of functions encountered:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> carver.called_functions()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `arguments()` method lists the arguments recorded for a function.  This is a mapping of the function name to a list of lists of arguments; each argument is a pair (parameter name, value).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> carver.arguments('my_sqrt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Complex arguments are properly serialized, such that they can be easily restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthesizing Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "While such recorded arguments already could be turned into arguments and calls, a much nicer alternative is to create a _grammar_ for recorded calls.  This allows synthesizing arbitrary _combinations_ of arguments, and also offers a base for further customization of calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CallGrammarMiner` class turns a list of carved executions into a grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_sqrt_miner = CallGrammarMiner(carver)\n",
    ">>> my_sqrt_grammar = my_sqrt_miner.mine_call_grammar()\n",
    ">>> my_sqrt_grammar\n",
    "```\n",
    "This grammar can be used to synthesize calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> fuzzer = GrammarCoverageFuzzer(my_sqrt_grammar)\n",
    ">>> fuzzer.fuzz()\n",
    "```\n",
    "These calls can be executed in isolation, effectively extracting unit tests from system tests:\n",

    ">>> eval(fuzzer.fuzz())\n",

This is important for _regression testing_ – i.e. checking whether a change to code does not impede existing functionality.  We can build this by recording not only _calls_, but also _return values_ – and then later compare whether the same calls result in the same values.  This may not work on all occasions; values that depend on time, randomness, or other external factors may be different.  Still, for functionality that abstracts from these details, checking that nothing has changed is an important part of testing."
