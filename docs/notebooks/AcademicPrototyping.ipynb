    "Dynamic analysis is the ability to track what is happening during program execution.  The Python `settrace()` mechanism allows you to track all code lines, all variables, all values, as the program executes – and all this in a handful of lines of code.  Our `Coverage` class from [the chapter on coverage](Coverage.ipynb) shows how to capture a trace of all lines executed in five lines of code; such a trace easily converts into sets of lines or branches executed.  With two more lines, you can easily track all functions, arguments, variable values, too – see for instance our [chapter on dynamic invariants](DynamicInvariants).  And you can even access the source code of individual functions (and print it out, too!)  All this takes 10, maybe 20 minutes to implement."

    "In comparison, try to build such a dynamic analysis for, say, C. You can either _instrument_ the code to track all lines executed and record variable values, storing the resulting info in some database.  This will take you _weeks,_ if not _months_ to implement.  You can also run your code through a debugger (step-print-step-print-step-print); but again, programming the interaction can take days.  And once you have the first results, you'll probably realize you need something else or better, so you go back to the drawing board.  Not fun."

Search-based testing, for instance, evolves a population of inputs towards a particular goal, such as coverage. With a good dynamic analysis, you can quickly implement search-based strategies for arbitrary goals."

    "## Static Analysis in Python: Still Easy\n",
    "\n",
    "Static analysis refers to the ability to analyze _program code_ without actually executing it. Statically analyzing Python code to deduce any property can be a nightmare, because the language is so highly dynamic. (More on that below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your static analysis does not have to be _sound_, – for instance, because you only use it to _support_ and _guide_ another technique such as  testing – then a static analysis in Python can be very simple.  The `ast` module allows you to turn any Python function into an abstract syntax tree (AST), which you then can traverse as you like.  Here's the AST for our `triangle()` function:"
