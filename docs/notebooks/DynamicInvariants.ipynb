    "# Mining Function Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing a program, one not only needs to cover its several behaviors; one also needs to _check_ whether the result is as expected.  In this chapter, we introduce a technique that allows us to _mine_ function specifications from a set of given executions, resulting in abstract and formal _descriptions_ of what the function expects and what it delivers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These so-called _dynamic invariants_ produce pre- and post-conditions over function arguments and variables from a set of executions.  They are useful in a variety of contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamic invariants provide important information for [symbolic fuzzing](SymbolicFuzzer.ipynb), such as types and ranges of function arguments.\n",
    "* Dynamic invariants provide pre- and postconditions for formal program proofs and verification.\n",
    "* Dynamic invariants provide numerous assertions that can check whether function behavior has changed\n",
    "* Checks provided by dynamic invariants can be very useful as _oracles_ for checking the effects of generated tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, dynamic invariants are dependent on the executions they are derived from.  However, when paired with comprehensive test generators, they quickly become very precise, as we show in this chapter."

It is also a problem for testing, since, of course, testing needs some specification to test against.

We turn on tracking when the `with` block starts; at this point, the `__enter__()` method is called.  When execution of the `with` block ends, `__exit()__` is called.  "

Continuously maintained and extended for more than 20 years, it mines likely invariants in the style of this chapter for a variety of languages, including C, C++, C#, Eiffel, F#, Java, Perl, and Visual Basic.  On top of the functionality discussed above, it holds a rich catalog of patterns for likely invariants, supports data invariants, can eliminate invariants that are implied by others, and determines statistical confidence to disregard unlikely invariants.  The corresponding paper \\cite{Ernst2001} is one of the seminal and most-cited papers of Software Engineering.  A multitude of works have been published based on DAIKON and detecting invariants; see this [curated list](http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/pubs/) for details."
