    "# Code Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous chapter](Fuzzer.ipynb), we introduced _basic fuzzing_ – that is, generating random inputs to test programs.  How do we measure the effectiveness of these tests?  One way would be to check the number (and seriousness) of bugs found; but if bugs are scarce, we need a _proxy for the likelihood of a test to uncover a bug._  In this chapter, we introduce the concept of *code coverage*, measuring which parts of a program are actually executed during a test run.  Measuring such coverage is also crucial for test generators that attempt to cover as much code as possible."

    "## White-Box Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to black-box testing, *white-box testing* derives tests from the _implementation_, notably the internal structure.  White-Box testing is closely tied to the concept of _covering_ structural features of the code.  If a statement in the code is not executed during testing, for instance, this means that an error in this statement cannot be triggered either.  White-Box testing thus introduces a number of *coverage criteria* that have to be fulfilled before the test can be said to be sufficient.  The most frequently used coverage criteria are\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Statement coverage* – each statement in the code must be executed by at least one test input.\n",
    "* *Branch coverage* – each branch in the code must be taken by at least one test input.  (This translates to each `if` and `while` decision once being true, and once being false.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these, there are far more coverage criteria, including sequences of branches taken, loop iterations taken (zero, one, many), data flows between variable definitions and usages, and many more; \\cite{Pezze2008} has a great overview."

    "* The two blocks following `if c == '%'` (one for valid input, one for invalid)\n",
    "* The final `else` case for all other characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in the same conditions as with black-box testing, above; again, the assertions above indeed would cover every statement in the code.  Such a correspondence is actually pretty common, since programmers tend to implement different behaviors in different code locations; and thus, covering these locations will lead to test cases that cover the different (specified) behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of white-box testing is that it finds errors in _implemented_ behavior.  It can be conducted even in cases where the specification does not provide sufficient details; actually, it helps in identifying (and thus specifying) corner cases in the specification.  The downside is that it may miss _non-implemented_ behavior: If some specified functionality is missing, white-box testing will not find it."

To this end, one _instruments_ the execution of the program such that during execution, a special functionality keeps track of which code was executed.  After testing, this information can be passed to the programmer, who can then focus on writing tests that cover the yet uncovered code."

Even better, it gets access to the current function and its name, current variable contents, and more.

To catch such errors, we would have to set up a *results checker* (commonly called an *oracle*) that would verify test results.
