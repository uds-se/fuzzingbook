Invoke it as `jupyter lab`.  It comes with a much more modern interface, but misses autocompletion and a couple of extensions.  I am running it [as a Desktop application](http://christopherroach.com/articles/jupyterlab-desktop-app/) which gets rid of all the browser toolbars.\n",
    "On the Mac, there is also the [Pineapple app](https://nwhitehead.github.io/pineapple/), which integrates a nice editor with a local server.  This is easy to use, but misses a few features; also, it hasn't seen updates since 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To create the entire book (with citations, references, and all), you also need the [ipybublish](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish) package.  This allows you to create the HTML files, merge multiple chapters into a single PDF or HTML file, create slides, and more.  The Makefile provides the essential tools for creation.\n"
