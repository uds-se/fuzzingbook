    "and then make use of the following features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter defines two main classes: `SimpleConcolicFuzzer` and `ConcolicGrammarFuzzer`. The `SimpleConcolicFuzzer` first uses a sample input to collect predicates encountered. The fuzzer then negates random predicates to generate new input constraints. These, when solved, produce inputs that explore paths that are close to the original path.\n",

A SAT solver is being used to check whether boolean formulas in first order logic (e.g `(a | b ) & (~a | ~b)`) can be satisfied using any assignments for the variables (e.g `a = true, b = false`). An SMT solver extends these SAT solvers to specific background theories -- for example, _theory of integers_, or _theory of strings_. That is, given a string constraint expressed as a formula with string variables (e.g `h + t == 'hello,world'`), an SMT solver that understands _theory of strings_ can be used to check if that constraint can be satisfied, and if satisfiable, provide an instantiation of concrete values for the variables used in the formula (e.g `h = 'hello,', t = 'world'`)."

    "* Concolic execution can often provide more information than taint analysis with respect to the program behavior. However, this comes at a much larger runtime cost. Hence, unlike taint analysis, real-time analysis is often not possible.\n",

    "* Similar to taint analysis, concolic execution also suffers from limitations such as indirect control flow and internal function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicates from concolic execution can be used in conjunction with fuzzing to provide an even more robust indication of incorrect behavior than taints, and can be used to create grammars that are better at producing valid inputs."
