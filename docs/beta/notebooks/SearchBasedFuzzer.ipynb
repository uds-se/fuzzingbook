    "# Search-Based Fuzzing\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we are not only interested in fuzzing as many as possible diverse program inputs, but in deriving *specific* test inputs that achieve some objective, such as reaching specific statements in a program. When we have an idea of what we are looking for, then we can *search* for it. Search algorithms are at the core of computer science, but applying classic search algorithms like breadth or depth first search to search for tests is unrealistic, because these algorithms potentially require us to look at all possible inputs. However, domain-knowledge can be used to overcome this problem. For example, if we can estimate which of several program inputs is closer to the one we are looking for, then this information can guide us to reach the target quicker – this information is known as a *heuristic*. The way heuristics are applied systematically is captured in *meta-heuristic* search algorithms. The \"meta\" denotes that these algorithms are generic and can be instantiated differently to different problems. Meta-heuristics often take inspiration from processes observed in nature. For example, there are algorithms mimicking evolutionary processes, swarm intelligence, or chemical reactions. In general, they are much more efficient than exhaustive search approaches such that they can be applied to vast search spaces – search spaces as vast as the domain of program inputs are no problem for them."

    "\n",
    "All meta-heuristics are based on the use of a heuristic function that estimates how good a given candidate solution is; this \"goodness\" is typically called the *fitness* of an individual, and the heuristic that estimates the fitness is the *fitness function*. The fitness function is a function that maps any point in the search space to a numerical value, the fitness value. The better a candidate solution in the search space with respect to being an optimal solution, the better its fitness value. Thus, if you plot each point in the search space with its fitness value as the height, you get a landscape with the optimal solution represented as the highest peak."

    "The fitness function should calculate the distance value for concrete test executions. That is, we want to run the program, and then learn the distance value of this execution. However, the branching condition is hidden within the source code of the target function, and its value may in principle be the result of various calculations along the execution path reaching it. Even though in our example the condition is an equation using the input values of the function directly, this may not be the case in general; it might as well be derived values. Thus, the values we need to calculate our distance metric need to be observed directly at the conditional statement.\n",

The metaphor captures aptly what is happening: The algorithm tries to climb a hill in the search space defined by our representation. Except, that in our search landscape the best values are not those high up but down low, so technically we are descending into valleys.\n",

Thus, the value on the left-hand side of the equation thus differs *even more* to the value on the right-hand side of the equation than it did before the increase! So, increasing `y` does not seem like a good idea. On the other hand, increasing `x` by one improves things: The left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation become more similar; they are \"less unequal\". Thus, out of the eight possible neighbors of `(274, 153)`, the neighbor that increases `x` and decreases `y` (`(275, 152)`) seems best intuitively --- the outcome of the condition is still false, but it is \"less so\" than for the original value."

    "At this point it would be nice to run the hillclimber using the new fitness function, but there is a problem: Running our hillclimber with this fitness function is not a good idea, because it might never terminate. Suppose we've reached a point where all neighbors have the same or a worse fitness value. The hillclimber can move no where and is stuck there forever! Such a point in the search landscape is called a *local optimum*. If one reaches such a point, the easiest way out is to give up and restart from a new random point. This is what we will do in our hillclimber with *random restarts*. "

    "We restricted initial values of `x` and `y` to  rather small range of `[MIN, MAX]`. This is a common trick in test generation, as in *most* cases solutions tend to consist of small values, and using small values to start the search makes the search quicker in many cases. However, what if the solution we need is at a completely different place in our search space? Our bias towards smaller solutions would mean that the hillclimber would take very long to find the solution, and given a fixed search budget it would thus be less likely to actually find a solution. To see what effects this would have, we could simply replace the `1000` with, say, `1000000` or more. We can play around with the range to see the performance we get for our simple search problems."

In the `cgi_decode()` function we have three if-conditions and one while loop, and they all compare characters. Fortunately, as we have already seen, we can treat characters like numbers, so we can use the same distance estimate we used in the `test_me()` example. However, there are also two conditions which check whether a character is contained in a set, e.g. `digit_high in hex_values`. How close is a value to being contained in the set? An obvious solution would be to consider the distance to the closest value in the set as the estimate."

Consider the loop condition in `cgi_decode()`: `i < len(s)`, i.e., it uses a less-than comparison operator.

The following table shows how to calculate the distance for different types of comparisons:\n",

Furthermore, most modern programming languages use *short-circuit evaluation*: If there is a condition `A or B`, and `A` is true, then `B` is never evaluated. If `B` is an expression with side effects, then by calculating the branch distance of `B` even though short-circuit evaluation would avoid its execution, we would potentially be changing the program behavior (by invoking the side-effect that would in normal behavior not be executed), and that is not acceptable."

    "The variable `condition_num` is the unique ID of the condition that we've just evaluated. If this is the first time that we have executed this particular condition, then the true and false distances are simply stored in the corresponding dictionaries. However, it is possible that the same test executes a condition multiple times. For example, the loop condition `i < len(s)` in the `cgi_decode()` function is evaluated before every single loop iteration. In the end, however, we want to have a single fitness value for a test. As covering a branch just requires that at least one of the executions reaches the branch, we consider only the closest one. Therefore, if the `distances_true` and `distances_false` dictionaries already contain the distance from a previous execution, we only replace that value if the new execution was closer to reaching the branch; this is implemented using the `min()` function."

Let's also add the calculation of distance for the `in` operator and the `<` comparison, since we need both of them for the `cgi_decode()` example. Furthermore, `cgi_decode()` actually compares characters and numbers. To make sure we use the correct types, we first have to convert the characters to numbers to calculate the distances. This is done using Python's `ord()` function."

    "The `BranchTransformer` parses a target Python program using the built-in parser `ast.parse()`, which returns the AST. Python provides an API to traverse and modify this AST. To replace the comparison with a function call we use an `ast.NodeTransformer`, which uses the visitor pattern where there is one `visit_*` function for each type of node in the AST. As we are interested in replacing comparisons, we override `visit_Compare`, where instead of the original comparison node we return a new node of type `ast.Func`, which is a function call node. The first parameter of this node is the name of the function `evaluate_condition()`, and the arguments are the four arguments that our `evaluate_condition()` function expects: \n",

    "* the number of branch (for which we keep a count in `branch_num`), \n",
    "* the operator (for which we simply use the class name), \n",
    "* the left-hand side, and \n",
    "* the right-hand side. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python allows comparisons of multiple expressions (e.g. `1 < x < 10`); to keep the code simple we only deal with individual comparisons here, but it would be straight forward to extend the code by treating each comparison with an individual call to `evaluate_condition`. You will notice that we also override `visit_FunctionDef`; this is just to change the name of the method by appending `_instrumented`, so that we can continue to use the original function together with the instrumented one."

    "### Fitness Function to Create Valid Hexadecimal Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's take as objective to test the part of `cgi_decode()` that decodes valid hexadecimal codes. This means that we want to make condition 1 true, 2 false, 3 true, and 4 true. To represent such a path, we can simply sum up the branch distances for exactly these branches. However, there is a potential issue with simply summing up branch distances: If the distance for one condition depends on a comparison of very large values and the distance calculation for another condition depends on small values, then an improvement of the large values would very likely lead to a better fitness improvement, and thus bias the search. To avoid this, we need to *normalize* branch distances before adding them up."

    "A normalization function for a range `[a, b]` takes a number as input and returns a value that is `>=a` and `<=b`. The important thing about the function is that for any two numbers `x` and `y` the ordering needs to be preserved by the normalization. That is, if `x<y` then it must also hold that `normalize(x) < normalize(y)`. There are many different functions that could achieve this result; a simple one is `normalize(x) = x/(x+k)`: It is computationally cheap, and will normalize any positive value in the range `[0,1]` (to change this to `[0,b]` one would just need to multiply by `b`). If we use this normalization function, we also know the maximum value: it is `1.0`. The function assumes that the value to be normalized is positive. The value of the factor `k` defines the steepness of the curve. For example, for `k=1` (which is a good default value) the curve is very steep, with values quickly approaching, but never reaching, `1`."

    "The use of a fitness value in the search is typically explained using \"survival of the fittest\", but one of Darwin’s key insights on evolution was that selection is not only defined by survival -- individuals reproduce sexually, and sexual selection describes the selection pressure during reproduction. This selection is typically influenced by either combat: rivaling males fighting over a female, and the stronger (fitter) male wins; the selection is also influenced by display. Darwin’s example for this is the peacock: The peacock has long, beautiful tail feathers that appear to serve no purpose, and do not seem to support the concept of natural selection. However, peahens are influenced in their selection of a sexual partner by his appearance. Impressive ornaments suggest that a male is genetically particularly healthy and will lead to healthy offspring. This is reflected in a GA: The better the fitness value of an individual, the more likely it is to mate with another individual. A simple selection algorithm that reflects this concept is *tournament selection*: A small number of randomly chosen individuals compete to be selected, and the best is selected:"

    "Like in natural evolution, the individuals selected based on their fitness reproduce, to form a new generation. During this reproduction, like in natural reproduction, genetic material of the selected parents is combined. This is typically done by a process known as *crossover*, where an offspring chromosome is produced from the genes of its parents. In our case, a chromosome is a sequence of characters, and crossing over two parent sequences of characters can simply be done by choosing a cutoff random point, and creating offspring by combining the halves of the parents chromosomes based on the cutoff point."

    "A further essential ingredient of genetic evolution is the concept of mutation: Sometimes, offspring contain small changes in their genes, which represent new genetic material and new physiological traits. If the mutation introduced new genetic material that represents useful traits leading to better fitness values, then this genetic material will survive. If the mutation introduced useless genetic material, then the resulting individuals will likely have bad fitness values and die off quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect is that both, mutation and crossover, are probabilistic actions. They do not always happen, and their effects are different every time they do happen. For a sequence genetic encoding, a common approach is to first use a probability to decide whether to apply mutation, and then to select one gene and change it a bit. Alternatively, we can probabilistically mutate genes such that on average one is changed. We do this by calculating a probability `P` of each gene being mutated as 1/(number of genes). Then, if a gene is mutated, we don't just replace it by a random character, but make it more likely that there is only a small change. This is achieved by sampling from a Gaussian distribution with the current value as the mean. We arbitrarily use a standard deviation of 100 to make small changes more likely than large changes."

    "* A meta-heuristic search problem consists of an algorithm, a representation, and a fitness function.\n",
    "* For test generation, fitness functions typically estimate how close an execution comes to a target location. To determine this distance, we use instrumentation to calculate the distance during test execution.\n",
    "* Local search algorithms like hillcimbing work well when the neighborhood is well-defined and not too large.\n",
    "* Global search algorithms like genetic algorithms are very flexible and scale up well to larger test problems."
