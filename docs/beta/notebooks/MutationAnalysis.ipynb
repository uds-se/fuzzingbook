    "\n",
    "In the [chapter on coverage](Coverage.ipynb), we showed how one can identify which parts of the program are executed by a program, and hence get a sense of the effectiveness of a set of test cases in covering the program structure.  However, coverage alone may not be the best measure for the effectiveness of a test, as one can have great coverage without ever checking a result for correctness.  In this chapter, we introduce another means for assessing the effectiveness of a test suite: After injecting *mutations* – _artificial faults_ – into the code, we check whether a test suite can detect these artificial faults.  The idea is that if it fails to detect such mutations, it will also miss real bugs."

    "One of the problems with [structural coverage](Coverage.ipynb) measures is that it fails to check whether the program executions generated by the test suite were actually _correct_. That is, an execution that produces a wrong output that is unnoticed by the test suite is counted exactly the same as an execution that produces the right output for coverage. Indeed, if one deletes the assertions in a typical test case, the coverage would not change for the new test suite, but the new test suite is much less useful than the original one.

    "Mutation Analysis offers an alternative solution to assess the effectiveness of a test suite.  The idea of mutation analysis is to seed _artificial faults_, known as *mutations*, into the program code, and to check whether the test suite finds them.  Such a mutation could, for instance, replace a `+` by a `-` somewhere within `execute_the_program_as_a_whole()`.  Of course, the above ineffective tests would not detect this, as they do not check any of the results.  An effective test would, however; and the assumption is that the more effective a test is in finding _artificial_ faults, the more effective it would be in finding _real_ faults."

    "The insight from Mutation Analysis is to consider the probability of insertion of a bug from the perspective of a programmer. If one assumes that the attention received by each program element in the program is sufficiently similar, one can further assume that each token in the program has a similar probability of being incorrectly transcribed. Of course, the programmer will correct any mistakes that gets detected by the compilers (or other static analysis tools). So the set of valid tokens different from the original that make it past the compilation stage is considered to be its possible set of _mutations_ that represent the _probable faults_ in the program. A test suite is then judged by its capability to detect (and hence prevent) such mutations. The proportion of such mutants detected over all _valid_ mutants produced is taken as the mutation score. In this chapter, we see how one can implement Mutation Analysis in Python programs. The mutation score obtained represents the ability of any program analysis tools to prevent faults, and can be used to judge static test suites, test generators such as fuzzers, and also static and symbolic execution frameworks."

The problem is that collecting such a set of _unbiased_ faults is rather expensive. It is difficult to create good faults that are reasonably hard to detect, and it is a manual process. Given that it is a manual process, the generated faults will be biased by the preconceptions of the developer who creates it.

The key insight is that, if one assumes that the programmer understands the program in question, the majority of errors made are very likely small transcription errors (a small number of tokens). A compiler will likely catch most of these errors. Hence, the majority of residual faults in a program is likely to be due to small (single token) variations at certain points in the structure of the program from the correct program (This particular assumption is called the *Competent Programmer Hypothesis* or the *Finite Neighborhood Hypothesis*).\n",

The idea is to simply generate *all* possible *valid* variants of the program that differs from the original by a small change (such as a single token change) (Such variants are called *mutants*).

This means that `mutant 1` does not represent a fault. These kinds of mutants that do not represent a fault are called *Equivalent mutants*. The problem with equivalent mutants is that it becomes very difficult to judge the mutation score in the presence of equivalent mutants. For example, with a mutation score of 70%, anywhere from 0 to 30% of the mutants may be equivalent. Hence, without knowing the actual number of equivalent mutants, it is impossible to judge how much the tests can be improved. We discuss two methods to deal with equivalent mutants."

    "The basic idea is to compute the result of the complete test matrix $T \\times M$ of each test against each mutant. The variable $f_1$ represents the number of mutants that were killed exactly once, and the variable $f_2$ represents the number of variables that were killed exactly twice. $S(n)$ is the total number of mutants killed. Here, $\\hat{S}_{Chao1}$ provides the estimate of the true number of mutants. If $M$ is the total mutants generated, then $M - \\hat{S}_{Chao1}$ represents the number of **immortal** mutants. Note that these **immortal** mutants are somewhat different from the traditional equivalent mutants in that the **mortality** depends on the oracle used to distinguish variant behavior. That is, if one uses a fuzzer that relies on errors thrown to detect killing, it will not detect mutants that produce different output but does not throw an error. Hence, the *Chao1* estimate will essentially be the asymptote value of mutants the fuzzer can detect if it is given an infinite amount of time. The **immortal** mutant estimate will approach true **equivalent** mutant estimate when the oracle used is sufficiently strong.\n",

    "### Exercise 2: Optimizing Mutation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Our technique for mutation analysis is somewhat inefficient in that we run the tests even on mutants that have mutations in code not covered by the test case. Test cases have no possibility of detecting errors on portions of code they do not cover. Hence, one of the simplest optimizations is to first recover the coverage information from the given test case, and only run the test case on mutants where the mutations lie in the code being covered by the test case. Can you modify the `MuFunctionAnalyzer` to incorporate recovering coverage as the first step?"

    "### Exercise 4: Estimating Residual Defect Density\n",
    "\n",
    "The defect density of a program is the number of defects in a program that that were detected before release divided by the program size. The residual defect density is the percentage of defects that escaped detection. While estimation of the real residual defect density is difficult, mutation analysis can provide an upper bound. The number of mutants that remain undetected is a plausible upper bound on the number of defects that remain within the program. However, this upper bound may be too wide. The reason is that some of the remaining faults can interact with each other, and if present together, can be detected by the available test suite. Hence, a tighter bound is the number of mutants that can exist *together* in a given program without being detected by the given test suite. This can be accomplished by starting with the complete set of mutations possible, and applying delta-debugging from [the chapter on reducing](Reducer.ipynb) to determine the minimum number of mutations that need to be removed to make the mutant pass undetected by the test suite. Can you produce a new `RDDEstimator` by extending the `MuFunctionAnalyzer` that estimates the residual defect density upper bound using this technique?"
