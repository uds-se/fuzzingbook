Once implemented, we can have the assertions check at runtime whether `my_sqrt()` works as expected; a [symbolic](SymbolicFuzzer.ipynb) or [concolic](ConcolicFuzzer.ipynb) test generator will even specifically try to find inputs where the assertions do _not_ hold.

It is also a problem for testing, since, of course, testing needs some specification to test against.  This raises the interesting question: Can we somehow _retrofit_ existing code with \"specifications\" that properly describe their behavior, allowing developers to simply _check_ them rather than having to write them from scratch?

    "The [DAIKON dynamic invariant detector](https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/) can be considered the mother of function specification miners.  Continuously maintained and extended for more than 20 years, it mines likely invariants in the style of this chapter for a variety of languages, including C, C++, C#, Eiffel, F#, Java, Perl, and Visual Basic.  On top of the functionality discussed above, it holds a rich catalog of patterns for likely invariants, supports data invariants, can eliminate invariants that are implied by others, and determines statistical confidence to disregard unlikely invariants.  The corresponding paper \\cite{Ernst2001} is one of the seminal and most-cited papers of Software Engineering.  A multitude of works have been published based on DAIKON and detecting invariants; see this [curated list](http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/pubs/) for details."
