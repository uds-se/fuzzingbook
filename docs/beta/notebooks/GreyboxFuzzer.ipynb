    "# Greybox Fuzzing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous chapter](MutationFuzzer.ipynb), we have introduced _mutation-based fuzzing_, a technique that generates fuzz inputs by applying small mutations to given inputs. In this chapter, we show how to _guide_ these mutations towards specific goals such as coverage. The algorithms in this chapter stem from the popular [American Fuzzy Lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) (AFL) fuzzer, in particular from its [AFLFast](https://github.com/mboehme/aflfast) and [AFLGo](https://github.com/aflgo/aflgo) flavors. We will explore the greybox fuzzing algorithm behind AFL and how we can exploit it to solve various problems for automated vulnerability detection."

For efficiency, only a coarse branch hit count is maintained. In other words, for each input the fuzzer knows which branches and roughly how often they are exercised. \n",
    "The instrumentation is usually done at compile-time, i.e., when the program source code is compiled to an executable binary. However, it is possible to run AFL on non-instrumented binaries using tools such as a virtual machine (e.g., [QEMU](https://github.com/mirrorer/afl/blob/master/qemu_mode)) or a dynamic instrumentation tool (e.g., [Intel PinTool](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/afl-pin)). For Python programs, we can collect coverage information without any instrumentation (see chapter on [collecting coverage](Coverage.ipynb#Coverage-of-Basic-Fuzzing))."

    "Now we introduce a new concept; the *power schedule*. A power schedule distributes the precious fuzzing time among the seeds in the population. Our objective is to maximize the time spent fuzzing those (most progressive) seeds which lead to higher coverage increase in shorter time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the likelihood with which a seed is chosen from the population as the seed's *energy*. Throughout a fuzzing campaign, we would like to prioritize seeds that are more promising. Simply said, we do not want to waste energy fuzzing non-progressive seeds. We call the procedure that decides a seed's energy as the fuzzer's *power schedule*. For instance, AFL's schedule assigns more energy to seeds that are shorter, that execute faster, and yield coverage increases more often.\n",

    "First, there is some information that we need to attach to each seed in addition to the seed's data. Hence, we define the following `Seed` class."

    "***Try it***. You can try other exponents for the fast power schedule, or change the power schedule entirely. Note that a large exponent can lead to overflows and imprecisions in the floating point arithmetic producing unexpected results. You can execute your own code by opening this chapter as Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "***Summary***. After pre-computing the function-level distance to the target, we can develop a power schedule that assigns more energy to a seed with a smaller average function-level distance to the target. By normalizing seed distance values between the minimum and maximum seed distance, we can further boost the directed power schedule.\n",

You can find out more about directed greybox fuzzing in the equally-named paper \"[Directed Greybox Fuzzing](https://mboehme.github.io/paper/CCS17.pdf)\" \\cite{boehme2017greybox} and check out the implementation into AFL at [http://github.com/aflgo/aflgo](http://github.com/aflgo/aflgo)."

    "## Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "* A *greybox fuzzer* generates thousands of inputs per second. Pre-processing and lightweight instrumentation \n",
    "  * allows to maintain the efficiency *during* the fuzzing campaign, and \n",
    "  * still provides enough information to control progress and slightly steer the fuzzer.\n",
    "* The *power schedule* allows to steer/control the fuzzer. For instance,\n",
    "  * Our [boosted greybox fuzzer](#Fuzzer-Boosting) spends more energy on seeds that exercise \"unlikely\" paths. The hope is that the generated inputs exercise even more unlikely paths. This in turn increases the number of paths explored per unit time.\n",
    "  * Our [directed greybox fuzzer](#Directed-Greybox-Fuzzing) spends more energy on seeds that are \"closer\" to a target location. The hope is that the generated inputs get even closer to the target.\n",
    "* The *mutator* defines the fuzzer's search space. [Customizing the mutator](GreyboxFuzzer.ipynb#A-First-Attempt) for the given program allows to reduce the search space to only relevant inputs. In a couple of chapters, we'll learn about [dictionary-based, and grammar-based mutators](GreyboxGrammarFuzzer.ipynb) to increase the ratio of valid inputs generated.\n"

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is still to sufficiently cover functionality, such that we can trigger as many bugs as possible.  To this end, we focus on two classes of techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to cover as much _specified_ functionality as possible.  Here, we would need a _specification of the input format,_ distinguishing between individual input elements such as (in our case) numbers, operators, comments, and strings – and attempting to cover as many of these as possible.  We will explore this as it comes to [grammar-based testing](GrammarFuzzer.ipynb), and especially in [grammar-based mutations](GreyboxGrammarFuzzer.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try to cover as much _implemented_ functionality as possible.  The concept of a \"population\" that is systematically \"evolved\" through \"mutations\" will be explored in depth when discussing [search-based testing](SearchBasedFuzzer.ipynb).  Furthermore, [symbolic testing](SymbolicFuzzer.ipynb) introduces how to systematically reach program locations by solving the conditions that lie on their paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two techniques make up the gist of the book; and, of course, they can also be combined with each other.  As usual, we provide runnable code for all.  Enjoy!"
