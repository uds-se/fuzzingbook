    "# Greybox Fuzzing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous chapter](MutationFuzzer.ipynb), we have introduced _mutation-based fuzzing_, a technique that generates fuzz inputs by applying small mutations to given inputs.  In this chapter, we show how to _guide_ these mutations towards specific goals such as coverage.  The algorithms in this book stem from the popular [American Fuzzy Lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) (AFL) fuzzer, in particular from its [AFLFast](https://github.com/mboehme/aflfast) and [AFLGo](https://github.com/aflgo/aflgo) flavors. We will explore the greybox fuzzing algorithm behind AFL and how we can exploit it to solve various problems for automated vulnerability detection. "

    "AFL is also a *greybox fuzzer* (not blackbox nor whitebox). Meaning, AFL leverages coverage-feedback to learn how to reach deeper into the program. It is not entirely blackbox because AFL leverages at least *some* program analysis. It is not entirely whitebox either because AFL does not build on heavyweight program analysis or constraint solving. Instead, AFL uses lightweight program instrumentation to glean some information about the (branch) coverage of a generated input.\n",

    "To instrument a program, AFL injects a piece of code right after every conditional jump instruction. When executed, this so-called trampoline assigns the exercised branch a unique identifier and increments a counter that is associated with this branch. For efficiency, only a coarse branch hit count is maintained. In other words, for each input the fuzzer knows which branches and roughly how often they are exercised. \n",
    "The instrumentation is usually done at compile-time, i.e., when the program source code is compiled to an executable binary. However, it is possible to run AFL on uninstrumented binaries using tools such as a virtual machine (e.g., [QEMU](https://github.com/mirrorer/afl/blob/master/qemu_mode)) or a dynamic instrumentation tool (e.g., [Intel PinTool](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/afl-pin)). For Python programs, we can collect coverage information without any instrumentation (see chapter on [collecting coverage](Coverage.ipynb#Coverage-of-Basic-Fuzzing))."

    "\n",
    "***Try it***. You can try other exponents for the fast power schedule, or change the power schedule entirely. Note that a large exponent can lead to overflows and imprecisions in the floating point arithmetic producing unexpected results. You can execute your own code by opening this chapter as Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "***Summary***. After pre-computing the function-level distance to the target, we can develop a power schedule that assigns more energy to a seed with a smaller average function-level distance to the target. By normalizing seed distance values between the minimum and maximum seed distance, we can further boost the directed power schedule.\n",

    "  * allows to maintain the efficiency *during* the fuzzing campaign, and \n",
    "  * still provides enough information to control progress and slightly steer the fuzzer.\n",
    "* The *power schedule* allows to steer/control the fuzzer. For instance,\n",
    "  * Our [boosted greybox fuzzer](#Fuzzer-Boosting) spends more energy on seeds that exercise \"unlikely\" paths. The hope is that the generated inputs exercise even more unlikely paths. This in turn increases the number of paths explored per unit time.\n",
    "  * Our [directed greybox fuzzer](#Directed-Greybox-Fuzzing) spends more energy on seeds that are \"closer\" to a target location. The hope is that the generated inputs get even closer to the target.\n",
    "* The *mutator* defines the fuzzer's search space. [Customizing the mutator](GreyboxFuzzer.ipynb#A-First-Attempt) for the given program allows to reduce the search space to only relevant inputs. In a couple of chapters, we'll learn about [dictionary-based, and grammar-based mutators](GreyboxGrammarFuzzer.ipynb) to increase the ratio of valid inputs generated.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. Try to cover as much _specified_ functionality as possible.  Here, we would need a _specification of the input format,_ distinguishing between individual input elements such as (in our case) numbers, operators, comments, and strings – and attempting to cover as many of these as possible.  We will explore this as it comes to [grammar-based testing](GrammarFuzzer.ipynb), and especially in [grammar-based mutations](GreyboxGrammarFuzzer.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try to cover as much _implemented_ functionality as possible.  The concept of a \"population\" that is systematically \"evolved\" through \"mutations\" will be explored in depth when discussing [search-based testing](SearchBasedFuzzer.ipynb).  Furthermore, [symbolic testing](SymbolicFuzzer.ipynb) introduces how to systematically reach program locations by solving the conditions that lie on their paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two techniques make up the gist of the book; and, of course, they can also be combined with each other.  As usual, we provide runnable code for all.  Enjoy!"
