    "# Code Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous chapter](Fuzzer.ipynb), we introduced _basic fuzzing_ – that is, generating random inputs to test programs.  How do we measure the effectiveness of these tests?  One way would be to check the number (and seriousness) of bugs found; but if bugs are scarce, we need a _proxy for the likelihood of a test to uncover a bug._  In this chapter, we introduce the concept of *code coverage*, measuring which parts of a program are actually executed during a test run.  Measuring such coverage is also crucial for test generators that attempt to cover as much code as possible."

Since we do not check the result of `cgi_decode()`, the function could return any value without us checking or noticing.  To catch such errors, we would have to set up a *results checker* (commonly called an *oracle*) that would verify test results.
