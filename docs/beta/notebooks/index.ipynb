    "__Welcome to \"The Fuzzing Book\"!__ \n",
    "Software has bugs, and catching bugs can involve lots of effort.  This book addresses this problem by _automating_ software testing, specifically by _generating tests automatically_.  Recent years have seen the development of novel techniques that lead to dramatic improvements in test generation and software testing.  They now are mature enough to be assembled in a book – even with executable code. "

As an example, if you are reading this in a Firefox, Chrome, or Edge Web browser, you can do so safely partly because of us, as _the very techniques listed in this book have found more than 2,600 bugs in their JavaScript interpreters so far._  We are happy to share our expertise and making it accessible to the public."

Starting Jupyter through mybinder.org normally takes about 30 seconds, depending on your Internet connection. If, however, you are the first to invoke binder after a book update, binder recreates its environment, which will take a few minutes.  Reload the page occasionally."
