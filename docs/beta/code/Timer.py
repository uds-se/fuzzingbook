The Fuzzing Book - Timer

This file can be _executed_ as a script, running all experiments:

    $ python Timer.py

or _imported_ as a package, providing classes, functions, and constants:

    >>> from fuzzingbook.Timer import <identifier>
    
but before you do so, _read_ it and _interact_ with it at:

    https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Timer.html

The `Timer` class allows you to measure elapsed real time (in fractional seconds).  Its typical usage is in conjunction with a `with` clause:

>>> with Timer() as t:
>>>     some_long_running_function()
>>> t.elapsed_time()
